- I get about 12 nodes from Cloudlab. The node is c8220 on Clem cluster
- I first run the microservice expeiment. I run each policy at least 8 hours but I fail to reproduce the `policy=ucbopt` and `policy=msevoopt`.
    - I use the script to plot the result of `policy=msile` and `plciy=propfair`
    - The figure tend is like Figure 10 Center and Right
- Then I use each node to reproduce the policy of cluster_sharing experiment at least 8 hours.
    - But I can not use the plot_result.py to plot the result. It seems there has some bug on the script or there has some problem on my data.
